It wasn't. It's now the next day. The lady in our assosciation keeps insisting that the water meter is in another condo. Which we can't access because the person living there is never there (it's being rented) Now we're stuck with no water, no shower, no teeth brushing, no toilets, and no food for certain meals....

POST: I've had two serious relationships prior to this one, both with women. They had no problem with me being bisexual and it was something known before the relationship -- my first girlfriend was also bisexual. I am now in a relationship with a guy. We've been exclusive for about a month. Having never faced this issue, I come to you, Reddit. Is this something that he needs to know? Is it really relevant to a hetero relationship, regardless of if one of the participants in the relationship is bisexual? If you guys think it is necessary, when do you think is the right time? I think my biggest fear is losing him because of it. I know that I should be with someone who is fine with who I am, but I really like the guy and I'd hate for my sexual orientation to be the thing that kills this.\"\n",

Our water was shut off due to non-payment. (we recieved no notice) and we had to pay all that was due ($1500) We payed this yesterday at 2, they said the water would be turned on immediately. It wasn't. It's now the next day. The lady in our assosciation keeps insisting that the water meter is in another condo. Which we can't access because the person living there is never there (it's being rented) Now we're stuck with no water, no shower, no teeth brushing, no toilets, and no food for certain meals....

POST: So, I have had this friend for a long time and we have always been there for each other. But about 6 months ago I moved here to the Netherlands to be with my partner (m23). This is our first place together here and we had to buy our own furniture. Needless to say we don't really have any money for trips. My friend is getting married in March in the USA and I feel really guilty out of obligation but I really don't want to go. I don't have the money for it and I don't want to leave here and miss my partner. Reasons for not wanting to go: 1. Money 2. Missing my partner. 3. Being incredibly bored once I'm there! I won't have a car or a way to get around, so I'll just be sitting in my parents house all day. I know it's bad that I don't want to go, but I am just really dreading it. Reddit, what do I do?\"\n",

First of all I'd like to apologize for my English, but as you will see (I hope not), I'm not a native speaker. I'm 23-year-old who recently graduated from university and just stared my first job. Now, you see, my job is interesting and all, but it's an office job and I feel I'm not suited for this. I'm the adventures type, I want something happening around me and going to work from 9 to 6 is just killing me. The one thing that I thought of is a bike trip mostly in Europe, Asia and North Africa. The problem is that I'm from a country with an average salary around 350 euros or 450 USD. My salary is a bit higher - around 450 euros, but still not enough according to what I read is needed for such a trip, witch is about 30000 USD. My question is if somebody has done something like this without any money and if they have some tips for me. I'm thinking about sleeping outdoors or helping some locals for food and a place to crash. Is this something that could work out? I'm planning to go with my girlfriend and I think not too many people would take us in. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\"\n",

When my husband tells him 'no' he stops what he's doing and sometimes gets upset to the point of crying (I think because his feelings are hurt).
